# ChatGPT on multiple PDF files

![frontend_img.png](frontend_img.png)

### This app allows you to upload multiple PDF files and QnA from within them using openai API key

There are two python files:

1- frontend.py (where I built the front end in streamlit)

2- backend.py (where the main functional code is defined)
